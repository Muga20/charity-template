Most of the recipients are without cars or transportation. However, some may have cars and be unable to drive because of health reasons or age. Just Be Kind will serve as a liaison between local churches and USDA food pantries to include Grady Health Care Food Pantry (Atlanta Food Bank); Sankofa Food Pantry; YMCA Wade Walker (Atlanta Food Bank) and Peace Baptist Church. Just Be Kind will collect the food from these entities, prepare and deliver, fresh wholesome nutritional food to the elderly, sick and homeless. </p>

                            We cooked, delivered, and supplied hot wholesome food to the elderly, disabled and shut-in when they were unable to cook for themselves.

														<p class="mb-0"> Just be Kind has noted an opportunity for churches to reach more of the communities they want to assist. Quite a few local churches have ministries aimed at assisting the elderly, the homeless and the abused. Unfortunately, information regarding each church’s offerings is not widely known and those needing help the most are often unaware of the resources available to them. Just be Kind will partner with these churches to confirm the offerings, additional community outreach efforts and getting the word out to the community. Just be Kind will continue to be a liaison: maintaining active awareness of services available within the network of churches and putting people in touch with these services based on need and offerings. Enclosed are a few churches with existing partnerships with Just be Kind:
                            Saint Michael and All Angels – Community Outreach Committee (SMV)
                            Berean Christian Church – Community Outreach Dept, Stone Mountain
                            United Methodist Church – Board of Director (SMV)
                            Peace Baptist Church – Decatur, GA

									   	 <h5 class="section-title mb-0">Serving Single Parents with Minor Children</h5>
										<p>Single parents with minor children are some of the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic; they have been tossed in between holding down a job or caring for their minor, school-aged children. Many have lost jobs, did not receive unemployment in a timely manner, and faced eviction. The current affordable housing crisis has adversely affected these families, as only 10% of eligible residents receive section 8 vouchers. Inflation is another factor affecting them, as prices on gas, groceries, clothes, and utilities have soared over the last two years. They desperately need help with rent, food, clothing, child care and emotional support. Basic life skills as well as mental health care are needed here.


                     Just be Kind Project is currently in collaboration with senior pastors looking to counsel and help with our community outreach efforts. Because of the mental health crises caused by COVID-19, staying home with abusive partners or spouses has caused domestic violence to become more prevalent. There has also been a rise in suicide rates during this time period. Having a physical facility to hold individual counseling, group sessions, basic life skills and additional classes is part of our vision. Being able to refer families to the appropriate resources is important to us. We have potentially identified physical facilities in both Dekalb and Rockdale counties to help us with this endeavor.

                     We wish that, going forward, we can network with other organizations, various churches, and government agencies to help facilitate healing and counseling services.</p>

													<h5 class="section-title mb-0"> Feeding the Food Insecure</h5>

														<p>We start with the senior population because they are often unable to prepare hot meals for themselves. The elderly in this county typically aren't receiving the aid and assistance that is needed for them to thrive. We are looking forward to working with the Division of Aging in Dekalb County, as well as the Atlanta Regional Commission, in order to better serve the elderly population in Dekalb County.

                             One of our critical goals is to have access to a commercial kitchen so that we can cook hot meals and deliver them to the elderly, disabled, and shut-in here in Dekalb county. This will entail utilizing a commercial kitchen in a church, or leasing a ghost or angel kitchen. We would create delicious meals out of nutritious fruits, vegetables, and plant-based foods, and then package and deliver them to this population, along with clean water and nutritious beverages. There is a strong consideration of a Just Be Kind food truck.

                              We are in collaboration with a certified Naturopath doctor who has the proper licensing to ensure that the menu is nutritionally sound. She will serve as a subcontractor and consultant for the whole foods and the menu we plan on serving to low income and food stamp recipients. We are currently in negotiations to provide preparation for cooking classes that are whole, plant-based foods to the Food Stamp recipients, in conjunction with a large nonprofit organization who currently works to serve these clients by adding to their current monthly allotment of food stamps. A curriculum will be incorporated as one of our efforts to educate the residents on having a nutritional diet.</p>

										<h4 class="section-title mb-0">Care kits for the Homeless – Ongoing Ministry</h4>
										<p>Over the past three years, the founder, Yvonne, having a heart for the homeless, shares some basic toiletries and some simple foods with the homeless who are temporarily experiencing homelessness, and who currently live outside in the Metropolitan area of Atlanta.

                    The strategy is to provide toothbrushes, tooth paste, masks, hand sanitizers, cheese or peanut butter, water, juices and a variety of toiletries to serve as an extension of God’s love.

                   This is a simple yet effective ministry in serving the homeless with hands-on immediacy. Going forward, small bibles and tracts can also be inserted into these care kits as an evangelical tool for witnessing.

										<h4 class="section-title mb-0">Needs Analysis</h4>
										<p>
                       Our emergent need is to incorporate Just Be Kind (Community Outreach) Project as a 501C3, having our first board meeting of the 4 members selected for the Board of Directors. Our goal is to have our first board meeting via Zoom by the end of 3rd Friday in February of 2022, submit Articles of Incorporation, and file the 1023 – EZ form with the IRS expeditiously.
											 The alternative to this is to have a nonprofit start-up agency and file all of the paperwork for our organization. because of her success with many other nonprofits.  One of her clients, who is a mutual friend just received a $100,000 grant from the United Way for her grass roots organization, that serves woman. The need here is to raise $1,000 for the fees for her services.  Her agency will also apply for up to 15 grants at that time, which she has preset templates all ready to go.

													<h5 class="section-title mb-0"> Annual Coat and Blanket Drive</h5>

														<p>“Just Be Kind Project” had our first annual coat drive in Stone Mountain in 2019.  Our success was due to collaboration with Champion Middle School on Mimosa drive. They held a competitive coat drive between the students to see what grade could donate the most coats. The 6th grade won the contest, and received gift cards donated by Chik Fila. Thanks to the generosity of the students and their families, 68 Stone Mountain residents received coats, hats and gloves. The local Kiwanis Club helped to pick the coats up and deliver them to Berean Christian Church on Panola road’s clothing closet, where the public was invited to shop for items.

                             Thrivent Action Community Teams were responsible for the purchase of some outerwear as well. As a member of Thrivent, we were able to award the winners at the school with small tokens of appreciation in the New Year.

                            Since we have been in the middle of a pandemic for the last two years, it has been difficult securing a location to house this event. We feel that giving coats away during the winter is simply the right and humane thing to do. It is a tenet of “loving your neighbor as you love yourself.”

                            Going forward, we desire to collect coats in a COVID-19 conscious manner. Here at “Just Be Kind Project”, we hope to connect with one of our local churches in order to collect and distribute coats. Now, at the beginning of 2022, it is not too late to clothe those who may not be able to afford a coat. </p>
